# Voice-Enabled Chatbot Frontend

## Overview
This React-based project provides a voice interface frontend for chatbots, enabling voice interactions instead of traditional text-based exchanges. The frontend is designed to be backend-agnostic, meaning it can interface with any chatbot backend developed in Python or other languages, making the chatbot experience more engaging and accessible.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition:** Converts user's spoken input into text.
- **Voice Response:** Converts chatbot's text responses into audible speech.
- **Flexible Backend Integration:** Compatible with various Python-based chatbot backends.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use and seamless voice interactions.
